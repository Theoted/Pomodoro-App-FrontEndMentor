## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project is THE project that allowed me to make my mark in pure JavaScript. 

Now I consider that I have the basics in JS even if the writing is of course to work on. I will be able to continue on more technical projects and potentially start learning framwork js.


### Continued development

The thing I need to work on is the writing and cleanliness of my code whether it is in css or in JS. 


### Useful resources

- [Most important ressource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7eHSAXW718) - This is THE ressource who helped me a lot. With this video I learned how to create a circle in svg and that was the most important part even if it was far from being the most difficult !
